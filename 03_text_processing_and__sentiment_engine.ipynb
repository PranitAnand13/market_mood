    "### FinBERT: Domain-Specific Sentiment Modeling for Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "FinBERT is a domain-adapted version of BERT designed specifically for financial text.\n",
    "While standard BERT is pre-trained on general English corpora such as Wikipedia,\n",
    "it often misinterprets words whose sentiment or meaning shifts in a financial context.\n",
    "For example, terms like *“liability”*, *“loss”*, or *“cost”* are neutral accounting concepts\n",
    "in finance but are treated as negative in everyday language.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this domain shift, FinBERT applies transfer learning with domain adaptation.\n",
    "Starting from a general BERT model, it undergoes further pre-training on large-scale\n",
    "financial news corpora (TRC2-Financial) using the Masked Language Modeling objective.\n",
    "This enables the model to internalize the statistical structure and semantics of\n",

    "### How FinBERT Processes Financial Text\n",

    "FinBERT follows the same transformer-based architecture as BERT.\n",
    "Input text is first tokenized using WordPiece tokenization, which decomposes complex\n",
    "financial terms into meaningful subword units. Each token representation is formed as\n",
    "a sum of token embeddings, positional embeddings, and segment embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The token sequence is then passed through multiple Transformer encoder layers,\n",
    "where self-attention allows each word to dynamically adjust its representation\n",
    "based on surrounding context. This contextualization is critical in finance,\n",
    "where the meaning of a word depends heavily on its usage within a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sentiment analysis, a classification head is attached to the `[CLS]` token.\n",
    "The model outputs logits corresponding to three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.\n",
    "These logits are converted into probabilities using a softmax function, allowing the\n",
    "model to quantify sentiment confidence. In practice, these probabilities can be mapped\n",
    "to numerical sentiment scores for downstream aggregation and trading strategies.\n"
